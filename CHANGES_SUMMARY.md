# Email Invite Links Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed
Email invite links were using `localhost` URLs, causing recipients to see a "Connect to Project" error page when clicking links in their invite emails.

## Root Cause
The invite URL generation in `src/services/database.ts` was using `window.location.origin`, which captured the developer's local environment URL (`localhost:5173`) instead of the deployed application URL.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Added `VITE_APP_URL` environment variable to `.env`
- This variable should be set to your deployed application URL
- Includes documentation comments explaining proper configuration

### 2. URL Utility Functions (`src/utils/appUrl.ts`)
Created centralized utility functions for URL management:
- `getAppUrl()` - Returns the configured application URL
- `isLocalhost()` - Detects if a URL is a localhost address
- `isDevelopmentMode()` - Detects development environment
- `getInviteUrl()` - Generates properly formatted invite URLs
- `validateInviteUrl()` - Validates URLs before sending emails

### 3. Database Service Updates (`src/services/database.ts`)
- Updated `sendInviteEmail()` to use `getInviteUrl()` instead of `window.location.origin`
- Added URL validation before sending emails
- Added warnings for localhost URLs in development
- Added errors for localhost URLs in production

### 4. UI Improvements (`src/components/dashboard/tabs/TeamTab.tsx`)
- Added visual warning banner in the invite modal when using localhost
- Added confirmation dialog before sending invites with localhost URLs
- Added improved error messages with configuration guidance
- Added AlertTriangle icon for visual feedback

### 5. Documentation
- Created `INVITE_LINKS_SETUP.md` with comprehensive configuration guide
- Includes setup instructions for production and development
- Provides ngrok and Cloudflare Tunnel setup instructions
- Includes troubleshooting section

## Files Modified
1. `.env` - Added VITE_APP_URL configuration
2. `src/utils/appUrl.ts` - New utility file
3. `src/services/database.ts` - Updated invite email logic
4. `src/components/dashboard/tabs/TeamTab.tsx` - Added UI warnings

## Files Created
1. `src/utils/appUrl.ts` - URL utility functions
2. `INVITE_LINKS_SETUP.md` - Configuration documentation
3. `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps for Users

### For Production Deployment
1. Update `.env` with your production URL:
   ```env
   VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```
2. Redeploy the application
3. Test by sending yourself an invite

### For Local Development Testing
1. Set up ngrok: `ngrok http 5173`
2. Update `.env` with the ngrok URL:
   ```env
   VITE_APP_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```
3. Restart your dev server
4. Test invite emails

## Validation Features
- Prevents sending invites with localhost URLs in production
- Warns developers when using localhost URLs in development
- Visual indicators in the UI when configuration needs attention
- Console warnings with helpful troubleshooting information
